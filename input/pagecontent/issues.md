## Issues

### Submit an Issue
IHE welcomes [New Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.Finance/issues/new/choose) from the GitHub community. 
For those without GitHub access, issues can be submitted to the [PCC Public Comment form](https://www.ihe.net/PCC_Public_Comments/).

As issues are submitted they will be managed on the [ITI.Finance GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.Finance/issues), where discussion and workarounds can be found. These issues, when critical, will be processed using the normal [IHE Change Proposal](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Category:CPs) management and balloting. 
It is important to note that as soon as a Change Proposal is approved, it carries the same weight as a published Implementation Guide (i.e., it is testable at an [IHE Connectathon](https://www.ihe.net/participate/connectathon/) from the time it is approved, even if it will not be integrated until several months later).

### Open Issues

- FAIS-001: Should there be a required grouping with ATNA actors or other security profiles?
- FAIS-002: Should the operation transactions allow accepting a Bundle of multiple requests or only allow a single request (which may be a bundle of associated resources)?
- FAIS-003: Should the cancel claim and re-process claim transactions use a Task resource?
- FAIS-004: Should the Beneficiary Manager and Claims Manager be combined into one actor?

### Closed Issues
