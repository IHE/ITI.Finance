The Finance and Insurance Service (FAIS) stores, categorizes, and facilitates the administration of centralized claims and finance
related data to care provision to patients within the HIE. The service receives claims/financial data from Point of Service
applications (including financing applications acting as a point of service interface outside of other PoS systems) and
curates the management of them.
